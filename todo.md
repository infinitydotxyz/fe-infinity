   [9:41 PM]
2. no filters on the tab? can you add price filters?
   [9:42 PM]
3. what are these items? are they available to buy? if so, where is the price displayed? (edited)

   On the NFTs tab:
   http://localhost:3000/collection/manekigang?tab=NFTs
   [9:43 PM]
   also add a 'add to cart' btn next to 'add to order' btn
   [9:44 PM]
   'add to cart' is simply a shortcut that adds single item orders to cart directly instead of 'add item to order' -> 'add order to cart' flow
