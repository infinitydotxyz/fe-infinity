use timeago.js? <div>Expiry date: {format(order.endTimeMs)}</div>

home page feed,

twitter and discord events showing up on feed

twitter bot to broadcast buy orders,

mobile friendliness and FE to be delightful in general

there are other types also
afaik cover, contain, padded are the types

Check the feed collection in firestore
For discord announcements see the readme for social-data-listener repo

Then make a feed page which will be basically the community tab on its own page but data is not specific to the collection instead will be global. So you need to create new endpoints and queries if they donâ€™t already exist

basically this is left: twitter, news, nft transfer and discord events showing up on feed

then start on the reservoir kit

animated gif craziness?
