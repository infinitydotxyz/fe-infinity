hey Infinity is asking me to sign in everytime I change networks. It's extremely annoying and the only protocol that does so. Can you please turn this off? I'll sign in whenever I need to be on the protocol
even when I switch to a random testnet I would get the infinity connection pop-up

I have it open in a tab typically, but when I change network and am doing very different stuff it will always bother me with pop ups
[9:17 AM]
Its the only thing I am aware that does it bcs I have many many tabs open at all times

So just to confirm this happens even when infinity is not the active tab right?
