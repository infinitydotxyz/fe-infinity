hey can you make sure NFT_TRANSFER, 'TOKENS_STAKED', 'USER_VOTE' events show up in the UI and user can filter them (edited)

check FeedEvent.ts file in lib repo
lmk once these are done
next big item we want is a 'product' home page (edited)

// export const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:9090';
export const API_BASE = 'https://sv.infinity.xyz';
